## About
Research Overflow is an innovative platform designed to enhance academic collaboration by allowing researchers to share their publications and engage in structured discussions. The platform enables users to upload their work, track engagement, and receive feedback through comments, ratings, and paragraph-level annotations. This interactive approach fosters deeper academic discourse, allowing peers to highlight specific sections, ask questions, and provide targeted insights. Researchers can also follow authors, search for relevant publications, and bookmark papers for future reference, making it easier to stay updated on developments in their field. By integrating discussion and feedback mechanisms, the platform helps authors refine their work based on constructive critiques while promoting knowledge-sharing within academic communities. Additionally, administrators oversee content moderation, approve publications, and ensure quality control to maintain a well-organized and credible research environment. Through its focus on engagement, collaboration, and structured discourse, Research Overflow empowers researchers to enhance the visibility and impact of their work while fostering meaningful scholarly connections.â€‹
